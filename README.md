# Emacs games

Some games written with the intention of me learning more emacs.

## Getting started

The simplest way of getting started if you are new to emacs is

1. Install emacs
2. Open the file containing the game you want to play directly `emacs <<name-of-file.el>>`
3. M-x/Alt+x eval buffer
4. M-x/Alt+x Invoke the mode of the game you eval-ed in the previous step ie. `tictactoe`
